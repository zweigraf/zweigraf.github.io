# FebruarySeven

I developed a little game for iOS devices. Though not yet published in the app store I am planning on doing so. The goal of the game is to avoid the red circles for as long as possible.

In addition to programming, I created the music and all other assets for this game. Graphical assets were done using Inkscape. Music and sounds were created using [Auxy](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/auxy-music-creation/id909573739?mt=8) on iPad.

This project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/zweigraf/february-seven).
