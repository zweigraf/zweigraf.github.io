<h1>FebruarySeven</h1>
<p>
    I developed a little game for iOS devices. Though not yet published in the app store I am planning on doing so. The goal of the game is to avoid the red circles for as long as possible.

    In addition to programming, I created the music and all other assets for this game. Graphical assets were done using Inkscape. Music and sounds were created using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/auxy-music-creation/id909573739?mt=8">Auxy</a> on iPad.

<p>This project is on <a href="https://github.com/zweigraf/february-seven">GitHub</a>.</p>
